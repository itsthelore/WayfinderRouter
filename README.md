# Wayfinder

Wayfinder is a local-first model router and native Apple AI environment. It
scores each request locally, chooses an eligible destination, and keeps delivery
policy separate from the application making the request.

The production router is implemented in Rust. Wayfinder Desktop embeds that
router inside the signed application bundle; no Python runtime, package, or
fallback is required.

## Products

### Wayfinder Desktop

The native Swift macOS app provides:

- conversation-first Chat with locally persisted history;
- automatic or pinned model selection;
- Apple Foundation Models delivery on eligible Apple Silicon Macs;
- opt-in ChatGPT account routing through a separately verified provider;
- OpenAI-compatible and Anthropic-compatible local gateway endpoints;
- native setup, connection, routing, privacy, and diagnostic surfaces.

Desktop releases use SemVer and `desktop-v*` tags. See
[`macos/WayfinderMac/Packaging/RELEASE.md`](macos/WayfinderMac/Packaging/RELEASE.md).

### Wayfinder for iPhone and iPad

Native standalone iPhone and iPad apps are planned for v0.2.0. They embed the
same authoritative Rust routing core and execute approved on-device or direct
cloud providers without requiring a Mac or localhost gateway. Optional Mac
pairing follows in v0.2.1 as an additional provider.

The governing contracts are
[`WF-ROADMAP-0016`](roadmaps/WF-ROADMAP-0016-native-mobile-v0.2.md),
[`WF-ADR-0047`](decisions/WF-ADR-0047-native-mobile-independence.md), and
[`WF-ADR-0048`](decisions/WF-ADR-0048-shared-routing-core-apple-embedding.md).

### Rust gateway

The Rust workspace contains the deterministic scoring core, configuration
parser, provider clients, bounded HTTP gateway, service integration, native XPC
clients, and command-line helper.

Build it with:

```sh
cargo build \
  --manifest-path rust/Cargo.toml \
  --package wayfinder-cli \
  --bin wayfinder-router \
  --locked
```

Then run:

```sh
rust/target/debug/wayfinder-router route "Summarise this request"
rust/target/debug/wayfinder-router serve --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8088
```

The gateway exposes:

- OpenAI-compatible: `http://127.0.0.1:8088/v1`
- Anthropic-compatible: `http://127.0.0.1:8088`
- Health: `http://127.0.0.1:8088/healthz`

The scored decision remains offline, deterministic, and keyless. Credentials
are resolved only for delivery after the route is chosen.

## Container

```sh
docker build -t wayfinder-router .
docker run --rm -p 8088:8088 \
  -v "$PWD/wayfinder-router.toml:/data/wayfinder-router.toml:ro" \
  wayfinder-router
```

The image is built from the Rust workspace and contains only the native gateway
plus its runtime certificates.

## Verification

```sh
cargo fmt --manifest-path rust/Cargo.toml --all -- --check
cargo test --manifest-path rust/Cargo.toml --workspace --all-features --locked
cargo clippy --manifest-path rust/Cargo.toml \
  --workspace --all-targets --all-features --locked -- -D warnings
swift test --package-path macos/WayfinderMac
node clients/shared/test/parity.mjs
```
