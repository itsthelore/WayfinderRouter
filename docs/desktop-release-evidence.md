## Clean-account lifecycle

Record the observed state and bounded recovery for each scenario:

- [ ] Fresh install and setup with no prior config.
- [ ] Existing hand-authored config is detected and preserved.
- [ ] Set Up Later, interrupted setup, retry, repair, and already-complete setup.
- [ ] Gateway install, one launchd owner, `/healthz`, UI quit, gateway crash/restart, logout/login,
  sleep/wake, and app relaunch.
- [ ] Missing, locked, denied, rotated, and deleted Keychain items with no secret output.
- [ ] Upgrade/reinstall and forced rollback preserve config, history, ledger/cache state, and
  Keychain items.
- [ ] Explicit switch between bundled Rust and Python/Homebrew rollback leaves one label/port owner.

## Apple Foundation Models

Run on eligible macOS 26+ Apple Silicon hardware against the final signed app:

- [ ] Availability and not-ready/ineligible states are truthful.
- [ ] Buffered and streaming local replies complete through the bundled gateway.
- [ ] Cancellation and gateway/XPC restart remain bounded.
- [ ] Delivery works while the menu-bar UI is closed.
- [ ] Copied, ad-hoc, wrong-Team, malformed, oversized, and timed-out broker interactions fail closed
  with sanitized errors.
- [ ] On an eligible never-configured Mac, Apple Local is preselected only after a live `available`
  response and still requires confirmation; existing configuration and Chat's `Automatic`
  destination remain unchanged.

## ChatGPT authentication and Sol delivery

Use the separately installed, compatible, correctly signed `/Applications/ChatGPT.app` version
recorded above:

- [ ] Release discovery ignores development overrides and rejects sibling, unsigned, wrong-owner,
  wrong-Team, incompatible, or malformed helpers.
- [ ] Browser/device login, refresh, cancellation, logout, reauthentication, and model discovery work.
- [ ] A configured Sol model completes buffered and streaming Chat through the Rust gateway.
- [ ] Stop, Busy, timeout, process EOF/restart, sleep/wake, signed-out, expired, and usage-limited
  states remain bounded and do not poison provider health incorrectly.
- [ ] Offline mode excludes ChatGPT; an explicitly pinned unavailable ChatGPT destination never
  silently falls back.
- [ ] Adversarial prompts cannot invoke tools, approvals, commands, file reads/writes, project/home
  access, browser/apps/plugins/skills, or sandboxed extra network activity.
- [ ] Wayfinder output, logs, accessibility, crash state, and diagnostics contain no token or auth
  file material.

## Native fidelity

- [ ] `docs/desktop-fidelity.md` is complete for this exact artifact.
- [ ] Reference screenshots are attached for required Light/Dark and accessibility configurations.
- [ ] No P0/P1 finding remains open.

## Automated verification

Record workflow URLs and exact local commands/results for:

- [ ] Python tests and static checks.
- [ ] Rust format, tests, docs, Clippy, compatibility, audit/policy checks.
- [ ] Swift tests on macOS 14 and macOS 26 Apple Silicon runners.
- [ ] Ad-hoc arm64 release-bundle build and deterministic architecture-policy test.
- [ ] Signed/notarized desktop release workflow.
