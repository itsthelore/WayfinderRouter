//! Provider delivery primitives and streaming translators.
//!
//! This crate is deliberately split between deterministic delivery policy and
//! network adapters.  The first migration slice exposes only the pure policy;
//! callers can exercise retries, circuit breaking, failover, and context
//! prechecks without making a provider request.
