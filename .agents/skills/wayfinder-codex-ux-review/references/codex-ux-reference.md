# Codex UX Reference For WAYFINDER

Use this as a stable lens for WAYFINDER reviews. Refresh from official OpenAI docs when exact Codex product behavior matters.

## What To Borrow From Codex

- Thread-first work: the user should always understand what task/context they are in, what the app is doing, and what can be reviewed next.
- Tool visibility: actions should feel available without becoming noisy. Use compact icon+label rows, clear states, and predictable placement.
- Review loops: make it easy to inspect a result, leave precise feedback, and rerun a narrow pass.
- Calm density: prioritize scan-friendly information, restrained contrast, small controls, and readable hierarchy over hero sections or marketing-style layout.
- Parallel surfaces: Codex separates conversation, terminal, browser/review, settings, and worktree state. WAYFINDER should similarly keep routing status, chat, settings, and diagnostics distinct.
- Explicit state: show running, degraded, offline, unreachable, loading, empty, and error states directly. Avoid vague "something happened" surfaces.

## What Not To Copy

- Do not turn WAYFINDER into a general coding-agent dashboard. It is a router and menu-bar utility.
- Do not import web-app card grids into the native popover. The accepted WAYFINDER direction is a flat native menu/list.
- Do not make decorative hero panels, large gradients, or one-off illustrations for core utility screens.
- Do not use Codex language where WAYFINDER has stricter privacy semantics. Offline mode is the only state that guarantees nothing leaves the machine.
- Do not rely on the Browser plugin for native Swift UI inspection.

## Native macOS Review Checklist

- Menu-bar popover reads as transient, fast, and native.
- The current route, local/cloud split, savings, and health are visible without explanation.
- Chat opens as an intentional deeper surface, not as clutter inside the glance view.
- Settings contains setup, keys, gateway state, and diagnostic actions rather than scattering them through the popover.
- Every row has a stable height, aligned icon slot, readable label, and clear trailing affordance when needed.
- Color has meaning: teal for local/interactive, amber for cloud/degraded, neutral for structure.
- Motion is brief, interruptible, and reduced-motion aware.
- Keyboard and VoiceOver paths exist for all controls.

## Browser Plugin Role

Use the in-app browser for local web previews, rendered docs, public pages, or the legacy Tauri web UI. For the Swift app, prefer app screenshots, SwiftUI previews if present, Computer Use when available, and direct source inspection.
