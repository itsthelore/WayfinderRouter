# WF-ADR-0031: Gateway Failover Policy (deterministic, invocation-layer)

## Status

Accepted

## Category

Technical

## Context

The gateway forwards a scored request to one chosen tier's endpoint and, on failure,
gives up: a transport error becomes a `502` and an upstream HTTP error (`429`/`5xx`) is
relayed as-is. There is no retry and no failover (WF-ADR-0004). WF-DESIGN-0010 proposes
the resilience features that daily production reliance needs — but one of them, *crossing
tiers* on failure, changes a property callers may depend on (answer quality, or cost), so
it warrants a decision rather than a silent default.

Two constraints frame the decision:

- **The deterministic core is sacred (WF-ADR-0001).** The scored decision — "this prompt
  is tier T" — is computed once, offline, with no model call. Any failover must therefore
  change only *how a request is delivered*, never *what was decided*. Failover is not a
  second, hidden router.
- **Two failure shapes exist.** Transport failures (timeout, connection refused) raise
  `UpstreamError`; upstream HTTP errors (`429`, `5xx`) are returned as a status. Both must
  be considered "this attempt failed," while ordinary `4xx` (bad request, auth) must not be
  retried.

## Decision

1. **Failover is an invocation-layer concern only; the scored decision is never
   recomputed.** For a given prompt and threshold the decision is identical with or without
   any failover. This reaffirms WF-ADR-0001 and is the property every other rule preserves.

2. **Retries and the circuit breaker are always on** — they change *when* and *whether* we
   call the chosen target, not *which tier* was chosen, so they need no policy:
   - **Retryable**: a transport `UpstreamError`, or a status in `{429, 500, 502, 503, 504}`.
     **Non-retryable**: any other `4xx` (fail fast — retrying a malformed or unauthorized
     request only wastes time).
   - Bounded retries with exponential backoff + jitter; bounds are configurable.
   - A **per-target circuit breaker** (`CLOSED → OPEN` after N consecutive failures →
     `HALF-OPEN` probe → `CLOSED`) with a cooldown, so a known-dead provider is skipped
     instead of hammered. State is in-memory, per process. All of it is computed from
     observed transport outcomes — no model call.

3. **Failover across endpoints is governed by an explicit `failover` policy, default
   `same-tier`:**
   - **`same-tier` (default)** — only try alternate endpoints configured for the *chosen
     tier*. The agreed tier is still served, just from a different endpoint; cost and answer
     quality are unchanged. With no alternates configured this degrades to "retry, then the
     existing error" — i.e. no surprise.
   - **`degrade`** — on exhaustion, walk **down** the tier ladder (cheaper). Keeps serving
     and **never raises cost**; may return a weaker answer.
   - **`escalate`** — on exhaustion, walk **up** the ladder (dearer). **Raises cost**;
     strictly opt-in.
   - Set per-gateway (`[gateway] failover = "same-tier" | "degrade" | "escalate"`), with an
     optional per-request override header (`X-Wayfinder-Failover`). The plan is **bounded**:
     candidates are tried in order, one step at a time, until one succeeds or the plan is
     exhausted — never an unbounded walk of the whole ladder.

4. **The default is `same-tier`** because it preserves the routing contract exactly: the
   tier the deterministic core chose is what gets served. `degrade` changes answer quality
   and `escalate` changes cost — each is a property a caller may rely on, so both are
   deliberate opt-ins rather than defaults.

5. **Failover is never silent.** Response headers report the target that served the request
   and whether a failover/degrade occurred (`x-wayfinder-router-served-by`,
   `x-wayfinder-router-failover`), so a `degrade` is observable rather than a silent quality
   drop. Cost and savings accounting (WF-DESIGN-0007) bill the target that *actually* served.

6. **Streaming fails over only before the first byte reaches the client.** Once SSE chunks
   are flowing, switching upstreams would corrupt the response, so a mid-stream failure
   stays a terminal SSE error (the current behavior).

7. **`degrade`-to-local is the same primitive a budget breach will reuse** (WF-ROADMAP-0006
   item 6): "out of headroom → serve from the cheaper tier." Building it here means the
   budget feature inherits it.

## Consequences

- **Production resilience** without touching the decision path — and the determinism is
  testable: assert the scored decision is identical regardless of failover.
- **On-brand degrade**: a router that already knows a cheaper arm can keep serving through
  an outage where a single-target proxy would just `502`.
- **Risk — `escalate` raises spend.** Mitigated by being opt-in, surfaced in headers, and
  later bounded by budgets (WF-ADR-0017, WF-ROADMAP-0006 item 6).
- **Risk — `degrade` returns a weaker answer.** Mitigated by being opt-in and surfaced in
  headers/logs (never silent).
- **Limitation — breaker/retry state is per process.** Multi-process deployments share
  nothing yet; a shared store (e.g. Redis) is a deliberate later option, not v1.
- **Limitation — no mid-stream failover** (inherent to streaming).
- Fully testable with a fake upstream that fails then succeeds — no network, no keys.

## Alternatives Considered

- **`degrade` as the default** — more resilient out of the box, but it silently swaps a
  weaker model in for an answer the caller expected at the chosen tier. Made opt-in instead,
  surfaced via headers.
- **Always escalate on failure** — silently increases spend and can stampede a pricier
  provider during an incident. Rejected as a default.
- **Re-score or learn the failover target** — a model call and/or non-determinism on the
  decision path; breaks WF-ADR-0001. Rejected.
- **Delegate failover to an upstream proxy (e.g. LiteLLM in front)** — concedes a
  table-stakes feature and pushes operational complexity onto users; a router that cannot
  survive a provider hiccup will not be trusted in production. Rejected.
- **Status quo (better error messages, no failover)** — insufficient for daily production
  reliance.

## Success Measures

- A chaos test (kill the chosen upstream) yields graceful behavior matching the configured
  policy, no dropped request, correct cost attribution to the serving target, and an
  **identical scored decision**.
- `escalate` / `degrade` fire **only** when explicitly configured; the `same-tier` default
  never changes cost or answer quality unprompted.
- Retries with bounded backoff demonstrably ride out a transient `429`/`5xx` burst, and the
  breaker stops repeated calls to a downed target.
