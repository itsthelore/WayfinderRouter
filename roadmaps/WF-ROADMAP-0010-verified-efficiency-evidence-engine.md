# Roadmap: prove it, then scale it — the verified-efficiency evidence engine and the enterprise substrate to run it fleet-wide

## Status

Proposed

## Context

Every conversation about adopting a router — any router — ends on the same question: **"will
downrouting hurt quality on *my* traffic?"** Nothing Wayfinder currently ships answers it. The
savings ledger (`/v1/savings`, WF-DESIGN-0007) says what routing *saved*; nothing says what routing
*cost in quality*, on the adopter's own prompts, with enough statistical honesty to defend in a
budget meeting. That question — not features — is the enterprise adoption blocker, and answering it
empirically is the single capability that changes what Wayfinder *is*: from "a router you must
trust" to "a router that proves itself on your traffic before it touches your traffic."

Wayfinder is unusually well positioned to answer it, for a reason that looks like a weakness:
`benchmarks/blind-eval.md` reports, in public, that the **stock structural scorer scores below
random on RouterBench** (mean skill **−0.049** across the realistic operating band; the opted-in
lexical weights lift it to **+0.039**). No competing router publishes its own negative result. The
honest conclusion the blind eval already draws is that Wayfinder's value is *unlocked by
calibration on the traffic it will route* — which means the missing product is the loop that makes
calibration-then-proof a first-class, zero-risk operation:

> **shadow** (route nothing, score everything, sample small-vs-frontier comparisons off-path) →
> **calibrate** on the labels shadow produced (`calibrate` / `recalibrate`, WF-ADR-0007) →
> **evidence report** on the calibrated config, with trust gates and a flip/don't-flip verdict →
> **canary** a fraction with quality tripwires → **enforce**.

Shadow mode is therefore two things at once: the zero-risk deployment posture enterprises need on
day one, and the **label faucet** the calibration loop has always wanted (today `onboard` asks the
operator to generate labels interactively; shadow harvests them from real traffic).

Most of the machinery already exists and was built to be reused this way: the sufficiency judge and
its trust gates are already offline, deterministic, and re-runnable from saved logs
(`judge.py`, `sufficiency.py`, WF-ADR-0037); `build_app` already has a `dry_run` seam
(`gateway.py:1441`); the ledger already computes counterfactual cost (`pricing.py:181`,
WF-DESIGN-0007). What's new is wiring them into the gateway as an off-request-path evidence
pipeline — and building the substrate an enterprise needs to run that pipeline across a fleet:
shared state for the counters the tripwires and budgets depend on, operator identity, an audit
trail, traces, and a chart to deploy it all.

The hard constraint is unchanged and non-negotiable: **the per-request routing decision stays
offline, deterministic, and model-call-free (WF-ADR-0001)**. Shadow sampling, judging, evidence
statistics, and tripwire evaluation all run *off* the request path — background and post-response —
exactly as the judge does today ("offline / calibration-time only… no model, key, or network on the
decision path"). Every default in this roadmap preserves today's behavior byte-for-byte; existing
deployments upgrade as no-ops.

Two tracks, six initiatives. Track A is the evidence engine (shadow → report → canary). Track B is
the enterprise substrate (shared state + truthful money; identity/audit/traces/chart) and the
public benchmark program that makes the whole story reproducible. Each initiative carries its own
acceptance criteria — testable, empirical, and mostly phrased as regression guarantees.

## Outcomes

- An enterprise can deploy the gateway in **shadow mode** — 100% of traffic still served by their
  incumbent frontier arm — and after N days hold a **rendered evidence report**: projected savings,
  quality win/loss/tie with confidence intervals, trust-gate verdicts, and an unhedged
  **enforce / keep shadowing / do not enforce** recommendation.
- The path from shadow to full routing is **graduated and reversible**: a deterministic canary
  fraction, quality tripwires that fall back to the frontier arm automatically, and an audit record
  for every state change.
- A **two-replica deployment behind one Redis** enforces a single shared budget, rate limit, and
  tripwire — the counters stop being per-process fiction.
- Cost claims become **token-truthful and exportable**: input/output-split pricing, `usage` captured
  on streaming too, and a FinOps CSV export that reconciles against the provider invoice.
- Operators authenticate with **OIDC** for the dashboard/admin surface (virtual keys stay the
  data-plane auth), every consequential action lands in an **append-only audit log**, traces
  propagate via **OpenTelemetry** (opt-in extra), and `helm install` stands the whole thing up.
- The claims regenerate in public: a **standing benchmark program** (router skill, judge validity,
  evidence-statistics recovery, decision latency) republished per release with CI gates, plus an
  **operator's guide** (`docs/evidence-trial.md`) that takes a stranger from install to a defensible
  report without reading source.

## Initiatives

### Track A — the evidence engine

### 1. Shadow mode: score everything, route nothing, sample comparisons off-path

The zero-risk posture: the gateway forwards every request to the incumbent arm exactly as a
pass-through proxy would, while the scorer runs as it always does and the decision that *would*
have been made is recorded. A sampled fraction additionally gets a **background comparison**: after
the client's response is sent, the same prompt is sent to the would-have-routed arm and the two
answers are judged by the existing deterministic `HeuristicJudge` (`judge.py:98`) — producing both
evidence rows and `{text, label}` calibration rows in one motion.

- **A rollout knob, not a scoring mode.** `[gateway] rollout = "shadow" | "canary" | "enforce"`,
  default `enforce` (today's behavior — upgrades are no-ops). Named `rollout` deliberately: the
  existing `x-wayfinder-router-mode` header and its `scored | pinned | threshold-override` contract
  (`gateway.py:41`) describe the *decision*, which shadow does not change. New response headers join
  the family (`gateway.py:2029`): `x-wayfinder-router-rollout: shadow` and
  `x-wayfinder-router-would-route: <model>`, so a client can see the counterfactual per request.
  `build_app`'s `dry_run` (`gateway.py:1441`) is the seam this generalizes — dry-run returns the
  decision *instead of* the answer; shadow returns the answer and *records* the decision.
- **Sampling is background, budgeted, and off-path.** A `[gateway.shadow]` table: `sample_rate`
  (0.0–1.0), `arms` (names validated against `[gateway.models.*]` exactly like `fallbacks`,
  `gateway.py:392`), `daily_budget` (a spend cap on shadow-arm calls, reusing the `[gateway.budget]`
  idiom, WF-ADR-0032), `store` (JSONL path), `store_text` (default **false**). The comparison call
  fires after the client response completes, via the existing `aforward_request`
  (`gateway.py:1248`); it never delays or gates the served response. Background arm-calls from the
  gateway are genuinely new machinery (the judge runs only in the offline CLI loop today) and get
  their own ADR.
- **Metadata-only by default.** The shadow store keeps score, decision, verdict, token counts, and
  cost — not prompt or response text — honoring the standing posture (WF-ADR-0011/0014; the `recent`
  ring keeps "metadata only"). `store_text = true` is the explicit, documented opt-in for teams that
  want re-judgeable logs, following the `judge --save-comparisons` precedent (off by default, a
  response-body store). Retention: `store_days` prunes on write.
- **Projected savings become first-class.** The ledger (`SavingsLedger`, `pricing.py:181`) gains a
  `projected` bucket recorded from shadow decisions; `/v1/savings` reports `projected_savings`
  alongside realized, and the dashboard labels shadow deployments as such. Shadow-arm spend is
  recorded separately (it is a real cost, capped by `daily_budget`) and never counts as savings.
  New metrics in the zero-dep registry (`Metrics`, `gateway.py:192`):
  `wayfinder_shadow_comparisons_total{verdict=…}`, `wayfinder_shadow_spend`,
  `wayfinder_shadow_projected_savings`.
- **The store feeds calibration directly.** `wayfinder calibrate --from-shadow <store>` consumes
  comparison rows as labeled samples — the same shape `onboard` produces — closing the
  shadow → calibrate loop with no new formats.

**Acceptance:**

- In `rollout = "shadow"`, the forwarded upstream request body is **byte-identical** to an
  enforce-mode deployment pinned to the same arm (regression test on both streaming and
  non-streaming paths).
- `sample_rate = 0` produces exactly zero additional upstream calls (mock-counted).
- With a shadow arm deliberately delayed 10s, client-observed latency is unchanged — the comparison
  fires after the response is sent (timing test).
- Shadow-arm spend appears in its own ledger bucket, stops at `daily_budget`, and never increments
  realized savings.
- With `store_text` unset, the shadow store contains no prompt or response text (content-level
  test on a store produced from known prompts).
- The WF-ADR-0001 guard stays green: the decision path gains no model call, no key, no network.

### 2. Evidence reports: the flip-to-enforce artifact

Turn a shadow store into a document a platform lead can defend: statistically honest, deterministic,
and ending in a verdict rather than a hedge. This is a **pure-stdlib module**
(`wayfinder_router/evidence.py`), unit-tested like `sufficiency.py`, reusing the trust gates
wholesale: `cohens_kappa` (`sufficiency.py:41`), `confusion_matrix` (`sufficiency.py:64`),
`evaluate`/`GateReport` (`sufficiency.py:162,123`), and the κ floor discipline
(`DEFAULT_KAPPA_FLOOR = 0.6`, `sufficiency.py:35` — below it, refuse).

- **CLI first, endpoint second.** `wayfinder evidence <shadow-store> [--gold gold.jsonl]
  [--out report.html | report.json] [--min-n N] [--sufficiency-floor F]`. The gateway adds
  `GET /v1/evidence` (JSON summary over the live store; operator-authenticated once Initiative 5
  lands). The HTML artifact is self-contained, no CDN — the `demo.html` / dashboard precedent.
- **What the report says.** Win/loss/tie/**abstain** counts with Wilson score intervals on the
  sufficiency rate; per-score-band, per-vkey, and per-tag breakdowns; judge agreement **κ against a
  human-labeled gold subsample** (the operator gold-labels ~100 sampled comparisons; below the κ
  floor the report refuses a verdict and prints the confusion matrix, exactly the `GateReport`
  register); projected cost delta pinned to `price_table_version` (`pricing.py:54`) and showing the
  **estimated-token fraction** until Initiative 4's pricing work lands; provenance stamps — judge
  `version` (`judge.py:87`, `heuristic-1`), config hash, store row count, date range.
- **A tri-state verdict, never a hedge**: **enforce** (gates passed, quality delta within the
  operator's floor), **keep shadowing** (insufficient n, κ below floor, or intervals too wide — the
  report says which and how much more data is needed), or **do not enforce** (gates passed and the
  answer is no). Abstentions are reported, never folded into wins — the `HeuristicJudge` honesty
  rule carried up a layer.
- **Deterministic and replayable.** Same store + same gold + same flags → byte-identical JSON. The
  judge is already "re-runnable from a saved comparison log" (WF-ADR-0037); the report inherits it.

**Acceptance:**

- Identical inputs produce byte-identical `report.json` across runs and machines (golden-file test).
- Below `--min-n`, or with gold-κ under the floor, the report emits **keep shadowing** with the
  confusion matrix and refuses a flip verdict (the `sufficiency.py` refusal register).
- A synthetic store with a planted sufficiency rate and cost delta is recovered within the report's
  own stated confidence intervals (statistical correctness test, seeded).
- Abstain counts appear in every table; no aggregate treats abstain as a win.
- `report.html` renders offline (no external requests — same bar as the dashboard).

### 3. Graduated rollout: canary fractions and quality tripwires

Nobody flips 0% → 100%. The canary routes a deterministic fraction of traffic per the scored
decision while the rest stays on the incumbent arm; sampled comparisons continue on the canary
slice and feed a **tripwire** — a rolling quality floor that, when breached, sends 100% of traffic
back to the frontier arm on its own. The tripwire is the undo button that makes "enforce" a
reversible decision, and it is deliberately shaped like the circuit breaker
(`reliability.CircuitBreaker`, wired at `gateway.py:1552`): a small state machine with sticky trips.

- **Deterministic assignment, per conversation.** `[gateway.canary]`: `fraction`,
  `tripwire_floor` (rolling sufficiency-agreement floor), `tripwire_window` (comparisons),
  `on_trip = "shadow" | "frontier"`. Assignment is SHA-256 of the conversation key modulo 10,000 —
  no RNG anywhere, and **per-conversation**, riding the same latch that already prevents mid-thread
  tier flapping (`conversation_high_water`, `gateway.py:1189`, WF-ADR-0022). A conversation is
  either in the canary or not, for its whole life.
- **The tripwire runs off-path.** Comparison verdicts stream into a rolling window; the floor check
  happens on comparison completion, never inside a request. A trip flips the effective rollout to
  `on_trip`, increments `wayfinder_tripwire_trips_total`, writes an audit record (Initiative 5),
  and **stays tripped until an operator acts** — no automatic flap-back, the breaker's half-open
  subtlety deliberately omitted where quality is at stake.
- **Visible everywhere.** `x-wayfinder-router-rollout: canary` on responses;
  `wayfinder_canary_fraction` in `/metrics`; the dashboard shows fraction, window fill, current
  agreement rate, and distance to the floor.

**Acceptance:**

- Over N synthetic conversations, fraction `f` puts `f ± ε` of *conversations* (not requests) on
  the canary side, and the same conversation key always lands on the same side (determinism test).
- With a mock small model degraded to refusals mid-run, the tripwire fires within
  `tripwire_window` comparisons; afterwards 100% of new requests serve from the frontier arm, one
  audit record exists, and the metric incremented exactly once.
- Tripwire evaluation adds no per-request model call and no per-request latency (the WF-ADR-0001
  guard extended to the canary path).
- A trip is sticky across config hot-reloads until explicitly cleared; clearing writes its own
  audit record.

### Track B — the enterprise substrate

### 4. Shared state (Redis first) and token-truthful money

Every counter the evidence engine and the control plane rely on is per-process today — the code
says so itself: "one long-lived limiter; its window counters survive config hot-reloads"
(`gateway.py:1564`); the ledger persists to a local JSON file; the cache is an in-process dict.
Fleet-wide budgets, rate limits, canary tripwires, and a shared shadow store are impossible without
a shared backend. Separately, cost claims must survive an adversarial reader: the plumbing is
further along than it looks — `usage_tokens` (`pricing.py:60`) already prefers the upstream's real
`usage` counts and flags `estimated=True` on fallback — but a single blended `cost_per_1k` per
model and missing streaming `usage` leave the numbers approximate exactly where the evidence
report needs them exact.

- **A `StateBackend` protocol, Redis first.** `[gateway.state]`: `backend = "memory" | "redis"`
  (default `memory` — byte-identical to today), `url`, `namespace`. A new
  `wayfinder_router/state.py` defines the protocol; the adapters live where the state lives:
  `RateLimiter` is already clock-injected and lock-guarded (`ratelimit.py:33`) — its fixed windows
  become shared atomic counters; `SavingsLedger.record/spent` (`pricing.py:195,286`) writes through;
  `cache_key` is already the SHA-256 of the normalized request (`cache.py:38`) — trivially a Redis
  key. The redis client ships behind a `wayfinder-router[redis]` extra; the pure core imports
  nothing new (WF-ADR-0001 import hygiene).
- **Degrade loudly, never drop.** Redis unavailable → fall back to per-process counters with a
  prominent log line and a `wayfinder_state_degraded` gauge; requests are never refused for state
  reasons (the ledger's best-effort idiom, generalized).
- **Input/output-split pricing.** `[gateway.models.<name>]` gains `cost_in_per_1k` /
  `cost_out_per_1k`; blended `cost_per_1k` remains supported (deprecated, documented). Streaming
  forwards inject `stream_options: {"include_usage": true}` so streamed turns carry real `usage`
  and `estimated` goes to false. An optional tokenizer plugin ships as an extra for providers that
  return no usage — never on the decision path.
- **FinOps export.** `GET /v1/savings/export?format=csv&period=30d`: per-day, per-vkey, per-model
  rows — realized spend, counterfactual frontier spend, savings, token counts, estimated fraction,
  `price_table_version` — with FOCUS-compatible column names, building on the per-vkey attribution
  the ledger already does (`gateway.py:1502`, WF-ADR-0035).

**Acceptance:**

- Two gateway replicas against one Redis enforce a **single** shared RPM limit and budget: N
  requests split across replicas trip at exactly the shared threshold (docker-compose integration
  test, run in CI).
- `backend = "memory"` leaves every existing test green with zero behavioral diff (regression).
- Against a mock provider returning real `usage`, a 30-day CSV export reconciles with the mock's
  invoice within 1%, and every streamed row has `estimated=false`.
- Killing Redis mid-run degrades to per-process counters with the gauge set and no dropped
  requests; restoring Redis resumes shared counting.

### 5. The enterprise trust surface: OIDC, audit log, OpenTelemetry, Helm

Procurement clears on identity, auditability, and deployability. The evidence report is only
credible if access to it — and to rollout flips — is governed and recorded. Data-plane auth is
already right-sized (virtual keys: hashed bearer tokens with per-key budgets/limits/allowlists,
`vkeys.py:30,46`, WF-ADR-0035) and **stays**; what's missing is operator identity on the admin
surface, currently a single env-var bearer token in the feedback style (`_FEEDBACK_TOKEN_ENV`,
`gateway.py:107`).

- **OIDC for operators, vkeys for the data plane.** `[gateway.auth]`: `mode = "vkeys" | "oidc" |
  "both"` (default `vkeys` — today's behavior), `issuer`, `audience`, `jwks_url`, `admin_claim`.
  OIDC (JWT validation against the IdP's JWKS) guards `/router*`, `/v1/savings*`, `/v1/evidence`,
  and rollout-flip operations; `/v1/chat/completions` and `/v1/messages` keep virtual keys. No
  sessions, no user store — the IdP owns identity.
- **Append-only audit log.** `wayfinder-audit.jsonl`: config reloads, rollout flips, tripwire trips
  and clears, auth failures on admin surfaces, exports — each record actor (OIDC subject or vkey
  id), timestamp, action, before/after. Never prompt text. Written through the `StateBackend` when
  shared, local JSONL otherwise.
- **OpenTelemetry as an extra, zero-dep posture preserved.** `wayfinder-router[otel]`: spans for
  request → decision → delivery, `traceparent` propagated to upstreams, and a JSON structured-log
  toggle. With the extra absent, the gateway imports nothing new and `/metrics`
  (`gateway.py:192`, WF-ADR-0018) is unchanged — OTel augments, never replaces.
- **Helm chart.** `deploy/helm/wayfinder-router/`: replicas + Redis (Initiative 4) + ingress with
  TLS terminated at the ingress — the gateway itself grows no TLS; the chart documents the
  boundary, consistent with the SECURITY.md posture.

**Acceptance:**

- With `mode = "oidc"`, dashboard/savings/evidence endpoints return 401 without a valid JWT while
  chat with a valid vkey is unaffected; with `mode = "vkeys"` (default), behavior is byte-identical
  to today (regression).
- Every rollout flip, tripwire trip/clear, and config reload yields exactly one audit record with a
  non-empty actor; the audit file is append-only under concurrent writers.
- With the otel extra not installed, `import wayfinder_router.gateway` pulls no new third-party
  modules (import-hygiene test, same style as the standalone-invariant CI gate); with it installed,
  `traceparent` arrives at a mock upstream.
- `helm install` on a kind cluster with 2 replicas + Redis passes Initiative 4's shared-budget
  integration test end-to-end.

### 6. The public benchmark program and the operator's evidence-trial guide

"Open-source gold standard" means the numbers regenerate in public — including the unflattering
ones. `blind-eval.md` set the register; this initiative makes it a standing program with CI teeth,
and closes the loop with a guide that turns the whole roadmap into a repeatable playbook.

- **Judge validation — the keystone benchmark.** The evidence engine's credibility rests entirely
  on `HeuristicJudge`, so the judge gets the blind-eval treatment: replay it over RouterBench's
  graded answer pairs (36,497 prompts, 11 models — `routerbench_adapter.py`) and publish its κ
  against the real graded labels, per category, **with its abstention rate**, in a new
  `benchmarks/judge-validation.md`, regenerated per release. If the judge is weak somewhere, the
  table says so, and the evidence report's κ-floor refusal is the safety net.
- **Evidence-statistics replay.** `benchmarks/evidence_replay.py`: generate synthetic shadow stores
  with planted effect sizes; assert the report recovers them within its stated intervals.
  Statistical correctness as a benchmark artifact (`benchmarks/evidence-replay.md`), not just a
  unit test.
- **Per-release regeneration, wired into RELEASE.md.** Router skill/PGR at the knee
  (`harness.py:81,149,154`) on RouterBench + RouterArena + blind splits; decision latency
  (`latency_us`, `harness.py:43`); the judge and replay tables. `make bench` reproduces every
  published table bit-for-bit from cached datasets, offline.
- **CI gates:** skill/PGR must not regress below the committed floor per dataset; mean decision
  latency stays sub-millisecond; evidence reports are byte-deterministic; the existing JS↔Python
  parity gate continues to cover the decision core.
- **`docs/evidence-trial.md` — the operator's guide.** The end-to-end playbook: deploy shadow →
  run N days → gold-label ~100 sampled comparisons → `wayfinder evidence --gold` → read the
  verdict → calibrate from the shadow store if it says keep-shadowing → canary → enforce. Written
  for a platform engineer who will never read the source, with the report's statistics explained
  in plain language.

**Acceptance:**

- `make bench` on a clean checkout with cached datasets reproduces every published table
  bit-for-bit, fully offline.
- The release checklist fails if regenerated benchmark tables differ from the committed ones.
- `benchmarks/judge-validation.md` ships per release with κ per category, the confusion matrix,
  and the abstention rate — never omitted.
- A fresh operator following `docs/evidence-trial.md` against a dry-run gateway reaches a rendered
  evidence report without touching Python internals (walkthrough-tested each release).

## The empirical benchmark program at a glance

| What | Dataset | Published | CI gate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Router skill / PGR at knee (structural + lexical opt-in) | RouterBench (36,497 graded prompts), RouterArena (809-prompt join), blind splits | `benchmarks/routerbench-results.md` + per-release delta | no regression below committed floor |
| Judge validity (κ vs graded labels, abstention rate) | RouterBench answer pairs | `benchmarks/judge-validation.md` (new) | κ floor per category; abstention always reported |
| Evidence-report statistical recovery | synthetic stores, planted deltas | `benchmarks/evidence-replay.md` (new) | recovery within stated intervals |
| Decision latency | canonical `dataset.jsonl` | results tables | sub-millisecond mean |
| Determinism | all of the above | — | byte-identical re-runs; existing JS↔Python parity gate |

## Non-goals (explicit, for this roadmap)

- **No LLM-as-judge — deliberately deferred, and local-only if ever.** The `Judge` protocol
  (`judge.py:78`) keeps the seam open, but an LLM judge is *not* a near-term path. The standing
  signal is the deterministic heuristic judge plus a human-labelled gold sample; where the
  heuristic cannot tell, coverage is reported honestly, not guessed. If an LLM judge is ever
  adopted it stays an explicitly labelled opt-in, off the decision path, and — to preserve the
  offline / air-gapped and "prompts never leave the building" guarantees (WF-ADR-0039) — it must
  run as a **local model co-located in the Wayfinder deployment, never a call to an external
  provider** — the standing constraint, WF-ADR-0043.
- **No change to WF-ADR-0001.** Shadow sampling, judging, evidence statistics, and tripwires all
  run off the request path; the per-request decision stays offline, deterministic, and keyless.
- **No quality *guarantee*.** The evidence report measures judge agreement on sampled traffic with
  stated intervals and abstention. It is recall-imperfect by construction and says so — the
  `blind-eval.md` register, not a marketing claim.
- **No hosted control plane or SaaS.** Self-hosted, bring-your-own-key, as ever.
- **No general RDBMS persistence layer.** Redis first, behind the `StateBackend` protocol;
  Postgres is a possible later backend, not this roadmap.
- **No multi-tenant org hierarchy or SCIM.** Virtual keys + tags remain the attribution unit; OIDC
  governs *operator* access only. *(Repealed by WF-ROADMAP-0011, which makes org identity the
  point; the non-goal stands for this roadmap's own scope.)*
- **No in-process TLS.** Terminate at the ingress; the Helm chart documents the boundary.

## Alternatives Considered

### The enterprise control plane as the headline

SSO/RBAC, shared state, OTel, audit, and a Helm chart as the roadmap's whole story. Everything in
that list is genuinely missing — but it's table stakes, not differentiation: LiteLLM, Kong's AI
gateway, and Portkey ship or are shipping all of it, and clearing procurement checkboxes never
answers *why route through Wayfinder at all*. Demoted rather than rejected: it is Track B here,
because the evidence engine can't run fleet-wide without it.

### Semantic / ML routing quality

Fix the below-random stock scorer with embeddings or a learned semantic classifier, competing
head-on with the vLLM Semantic Router. Rejected on identity: WF-ADR-0001 is the invariant every
shipped feature has been fenced to preserve, an opt-in `ClassifierModel` mode already exists for
those who want a fitted model, and `blind-eval.md` shows calibration-on-your-own-traffic recovers
the value deterministically. This path builds a worse Semantic Router instead of a better
Wayfinder.

### The ecosystem / distribution play

LiteLLM and LangChain plugins, an Envoy filter, Kubernetes Gateway API integration. Real adoption
leverage, but it multiplies *reach*, not *value* — it puts an unproven router in more places.
Sequences naturally after trust is solved, not before.

### Privacy / PII-aware routing as the flagship

Already proposed as WF-ROADMAP-0008, and worth doing — but it is an incremental deterministic gate
on the existing scorer, a checkbox rather than a 10x capability. Complementary, not competing; it
proceeds on its own track.

### A hosted control plane / SaaS

The highest theoretical leverage and the clearest contradiction: Wayfinder's posture is
self-hosted, bring-your-own-key, offline-first (WF-ADR-0039), and "open-source gold standard"
argues for doubling down on that, not hedging it.

**The tiebreaker.** The evidence engine is the only candidate that attacks the actual adoption
blocker — trust — rather than a checkbox; it is assembled mostly from machinery already in-tree
(`judge.py`, `sufficiency.py`, the savings ledger, the `dry_run` seam); it converts the published
negative benchmark into the product's central loop; and it is the "backed by empirical benchmarks
and guidance" goal turned into a feature. No competing router offers "prove it on your own traffic
before routing a single request."

## Success Measures

- **Time-to-evidence:** a fresh install reaches a defensible evidence report in ≤ 7 days at
  ≥ 1,000 requests, following only `docs/evidence-trial.md`.
- **Flip rate:** the fraction of shadow deployments whose report reaches an **enforce** verdict
  after on-traffic calibration — the one number that proves the loop works, and stays honest when
  it doesn't.
- **Fleet-readiness:** a 2-replica Helm deployment passes the shared-budget and tripwire
  integration tests; at least one external reproduction of the published benchmark tables.
- **Zero regression:** `rollout = "enforce"`, `backend = "memory"`, `auth = "vkeys"` defaults keep
  every current deployment byte-identical — verified by the existing suite running unmodified.
- **The artifact in the wild:** an evidence report exported and cited outside this repo — the
  budget-meeting test.

## Sequencing and dependencies

- **1 → 2 → 3 strictly.** The store format precedes the report; the report's verdict machinery
  precedes the tripwire (the tripwire *is* the report's floor applied on a rolling window).
- **Initiative 4's pricing half lands before Initiative 2 is called "defensible."** Cost-delta
  claims want `estimated=false`; until then the report displays its estimated-token fraction.
- **Initiative 4's Redis half precedes fleet-wide Initiative 3.** Tripwire windows and canary
  state must be shared across replicas; single-replica canary can ship earlier.
- **Initiative 5's audit log lands with or before Initiative 3.** Rollout flips without an audit
  trail undermine the trust story. OIDC can trail slightly; OTel and Helm parallelize.
- **Initiative 6 starts immediately.** The judge-validation benchmark has no dependencies and
  de-risks Initiative 2's core assumption — that `HeuristicJudge` agreement predicts real quality.
- Suggested release shape (CalVer point releases, per house convention): **R1** shadow mode +
  judge-validation benchmark; **R2** evidence report + pricing split; **R3** canary/tripwires +
  Redis + audit; **R4** OIDC + OTel + Helm + the operator's guide.

- WF-ADR-0001 (deterministic, offline, no-model-call core — the invariant every initiative is
  fenced against)
- WF-ADR-0004 (invocation layer + OpenAI-compatible gateway)
- WF-ADR-0007 (scheduled recalibration — the loop shadow labels feed)
- WF-ADR-0011 / WF-ADR-0014 (metadata-only logging posture — the shadow store's default)
- WF-ADR-0015 (benchmark methodology), WF-DESIGN-0003 (confidence/abstention), WF-DESIGN-0004
  (calibration loop), WF-DESIGN-0007 (savings counterfactual — projected savings extend it),
  WF-DESIGN-0008 (observability/cost dashboard)
- WF-ADR-0017 (cost metadata — split pricing extends it), WF-ADR-0018 (/metrics)
- WF-ADR-0022 (conversation latch — canary assignment rides it)
- WF-ADR-0031 / 0032 / 0033 / 0034 / 0035 (breaker, budgets, cache, rate limiting, virtual keys —
  everything Initiative 4 makes shareable and Initiative 5 governs)
- WF-ADR-0037 (automated sufficiency judge — the reused heart of the evidence engine)
- WF-ADR-0039 (offline-first delivery)
- WF-ADR-0043 (Wayfinder's own model use is local and in-container — the standing constraint behind
  the "no LLM-as-judge, local-only if ever" non-goal)
- WF-ROADMAP-0011 (the deterministic AI governance plane) extends this roadmap: it promotes
  Track B from table stakes to load-bearing prerequisite and repeals the org-hierarchy/SCIM
  non-goal above.
- Future designs, written when the work is scheduled: WF-DESIGN-0013 (shadow capture & comparison
  sampling), WF-DESIGN-0014 (evidence statistics & artifact format), WF-DESIGN-0015 (shared state
  backend).
- Future ADRs, named descriptively — IDs assigned at authoring time: rollout modes
  (shadow/canary/enforce); background comparison sampling; evidence statistics & the flip
  threshold; canary assignment & quality tripwires; pluggable shared state; input/output-split
  pricing & FinOps export; OIDC alongside virtual keys; the audit log; OpenTelemetry as an opt-in
  extra.
